# Goal
Having a a simple backend conencted to a DB to store and manage article for a blog.
BUT it changed ! I wanted to implement the Vertical Slice Architecture, just for the technical challenge cause Typescript and so Javascript are crappy languages, it asked to find tricks and fire the brain to the boiling point.
Which is even more exciting ! :D

# Vertical Slice Architecture ?
Take a look at Jimmy Bogard and at MediaR. this last one is a bit more than just Vertical Slice Architecture. Have Fun !

I didn't find much information about how to implement Vertical Slice Architecture in a Typescript/nodeJs environment. The only real useful source I found is the following (from the same guy) :
